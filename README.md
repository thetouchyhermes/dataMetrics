# dataMetrics

**dataMetrics** is a simple C project created for the Coding Lab exam at the Department of Computer Science, University of Pisa (di.unipi). The project demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts, focusing on file handling and basic data metric computations.

## Features

- Written in C for educational purposes
- Demonstrates file input/output and data processing techniques
- Modular code for easy understanding and extension

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC or any C99-compliant compiler
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thetouchyhermes/dataMetrics.git
   cd dataMetrics
   ```

2. **Compile the code:**
   ```sh
   gcc -o dataMetrics main.c
   ```
   _or, if a Makefile is provided:_
   ```sh
   make
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   ```sh
   ./dataMetrics
   ```

## Usage

Follow the prompts in the terminal to use the application.  
(You can expand this section with examples or command-line arguments if your program supports any.)
